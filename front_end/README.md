# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and a Typescript template.

## Steps to run application.
1. Steps (front_end)
   * cd `front_end`
   * run yarn
   * yarn start

Due to time constraints the app would require the following, improvements

### Challenges
Some of the images for in the works section can't be extracted/downloaded, leading to incompletion of the work section.

### Improvements
* Adding unit test for hooks
* e2e for for application
* Better UI optimization for web and mobile view
* introduce CSS Library such as Tailwind to reduce CSS-Boiler plates
* Abstraction of components and improved reusability
* abstract form validation into a reusable hook
* Add break-points as `::root` pseudo class
* optimize break-point for all modern screen sizes (use of css library)


### Architectural decision
Because this is demo app CSS were manually written with styled-component. For a more elegant design, a UI component or modular CSS library(tailwind) would be required to improve UI and development speed.
Also time constraints affected modularity of reusable components
